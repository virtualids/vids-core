## What is vIDS
vIDS is an open source project for VATSIM that tries to emulate the real world systems used by the FAA. It is created for free by volunteers and should NEVER be used for real world use.
Our current website can be found [here](https://idsv.net/)

## What systems are in vIDS
There isn't a set list of systems. However, En Route Information Display System (ERIDS) is the first goal to aid center controllers working complex top down airspace all by themselves.

## When will this project be done?
At this time, there is no timeline. The hope is that we can get one system ready for basic use and publish it. From there it will be fined and more systems can be created overtime.

## Other Information
*This document will be updated as necessary to reflect any changes in the project.*
*vIDS is originally created by Brody Carty, Samuel Valencia, and Brody Durrett pre open source. A list of other contributors will be included and all credit will be given.*

**NOT FOR REAL WORLD USE**
